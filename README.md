# Nest

![Nest Logo](/brand/logo.png)

**Free backend hosting provided by Hack Club HQ for every teenager in the world, but especially Hack Clubbers.**

Basic problem for us to solve: many teenagers literally can't deploy any backend services right now because they don't have credit cards or income and most hosting free tiers have disappeared (looking at you Heroku ðŸ˜”). We want to change that! As a public good! _Nest is a revamp of Hack As a Service ([v0](https://github.com/hackclub/hack-as-a-service-v0), [v1](https://github.com/hack-as-a-service))_

You can sign up for Nest in the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack) - go to [@Nest Bot's homepage](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/D05SEMRGQJD) (click on the "Home" tab).
